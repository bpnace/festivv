# Fixed Issues

## 1. ImagePicker Warning
- Fixed deprecated `MediaTypeOptions` usage in ProfileScreen.tsx
- Updated to use the newer `MediaType` enum

## 2. Gallery Display Issue
- Added error handling for image loading failures
- Implemented fallback UI when images fail to load
- Added visual feedback for users when images can't be displayed

## 3. User Profile Handling
- Improved error handling in useAuth.tsx
- Added better handling for foreign key constraint errors
- Added fallback to local storage when database operations fail
- Added proper handling for race conditions during user creation

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Database Foreign Key Constraint
The error message indicates there's still an issue with the foreign key constraint:
```
ERROR  Create user error: insert or update on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "users_id_fkey"
```

This requires executing the SQL script directly in the Supabase dashboard. The script is available in `fix-users-foreign-key.sql` and contains:
- Dropping and recreating the foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE
- Updating the user creation trigger function
- Setting up proper Row Level Security policies

### 2. Guest Access Error
The error message indicates an issue with anonymous authentication:
```
ERROR  Guest access error: Database error creating anonymous user
```

This requires:
- Ensuring anonymous authentication is enabled in the Supabase dashboard
- Checking that the proper RLS policies are in place for anonymous users
- Verifying the trigger function for handling new users works correctly

### 3. Camera Permissions Warning
```
WARN  Due to changes in Androids permission requirements, Expo Go can no longer provide full access to the media library.
```

This is a limitation of Expo Go and requires:
- Creating a development build for full testing
- Following the instructions at https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build

## Next Steps

1. Execute the SQL script in the Supabase dashboard to fix the database issues
2. Verify anonymous authentication is enabled in Supabase
3. Test the app with a development build for full camera functionality
4. Continue monitoring for any additional issues
